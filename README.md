# pygments-pg

A [Pygments](https://pygments.org) lexer for syntax highlighting of pg language code.
[WeBWorK](https://webwork.maa.org/wiki/) problems are written in the pg language.
PG is an extension to PERL and the lexer is based on the PERL Pygments lexer.

**This is a work in progress - status - barely begun**
